# Gaalop
Gaalop (Geometic Algebra Algorithms Optimizer) is a software to compile and optimize geometric algebra (GA) expressions into high-level programming language code. Geometric algebra expressions can be developed using the freely available CLUCalc software by Christian Perwass. Gaalop optimizes CLUCalc expressions and produces C++ (AMP), OpenCL, CUDA, CLUCalc or LaTeX output. The optimized code is free of geometric algebra operations and runs very efficiently on various platforms.

# Community Fork
This is a community fork of the Gaalop project to keep it alive, as such we are not experts in its design or use, just individuals interested in ensuring this code is still accessible and runnable.

# TODO:
[ ] Add some super basic setup and run instructions
[ ] Link to relevant existing documentation
[ ] Set up instructions for using the command line interface (cli)
[ ] Set up our own travis build and test
